# SumChords
Allows you to make arithmetic operation with song notes or chords.
Based on stringed instruments.

#How to use:
There are two types of commands you can use.

<b>'Chord ='</b>  
This command prints a list of equivalent ways of playing the same note or chord.  
(E.g.) The command 'B =' prints '= C11 D9 E7 F6 G4 A2'.  
This means, for example, that you can play a B note on the D string on the 9th fret.  
Or you can move your F chord 6 frets higher on the fretboard, making a B chord.

<b>'Chord + n'</b>  
This command prints the equivalent chord to the chord given moved n frets higher on the fretboard.  
The command 'C + 1' prints 'C#'.  
The command 'B + 4' prints 'Eb'.  
And obviously, 'C + 13' prints 'C'.
